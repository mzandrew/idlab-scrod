## SIMULATE_NCSIM.SH
##
##
## Description: A .sh file to run a simulation using the klm_aurora_example_design module, 
##              an example design which instantiates klm_aurora.
##
##              Ensure the follwoing:
##              The library paths for UNISIMS_VER, SIMPRIMS_VER, XILINXCORELIB_VER,
##              UNISIM, SIMPRIM, XILINXCORELIB are set correctly in the cds.lib and 
##              hdl.var files.
##              Variables LMC_HOME and XILINX are set 
##              Define the mapping for the work library in cds.lib file. 
##              DEFINE work ./work
##
